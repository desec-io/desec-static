Private customer data are stored securely in Germany where they are protected from illegitimate third-party access (like foreign intelligence agencies).\n\nThe German privacy laws are amongst the most restrictive ones world-wide, and the Supreme Court has set strong limits to what is legally possible. For example, unlike other member states of the European Union, Germany does not force Internet companies to store information about their clients' activities (data retention) since 2010. In this ruling, the Supreme Court ruled against a European law (which has been rendered invalid on the European level by a court decision in 2014 as well).",

            "content": "deSEC's first goal is to increase the security level of the DNS system. The DNS technology ensures that Internet users can connect to the intended web or e-mail server when browsing the web or communicating online.\n\nBeing from the 80s and not initially meant for the masses, the Internet was not designed with security in mind. Data transmitted through the Internet is by default not protected against espionage and manipulation. deSEC uses recent innovative technologies to avert such abuse, and to make the Internet more secure.\n\nWe start by cryptographically securing DNS information, to protect it from manipulation. To that end, we operated DNS servers world-wide equipped with the DNSSEC technology and based on Google-scale infrastructure. Additionally, we increase the security of encrypted connections using DANE (see below).",

            "content": "With DNSSEC, a client computer can verify whether DNS information was manipulated or not. That way, an Internet user can be certain to be directed to the intended web server.

            "content": "\u003cp\u003eAs described above, DNSSEC ensures that your data is directed to the right server – eventually. But even then, attackers can intercept and read traffic before forwarding it to the intended destination. This is also even true for encrypted connections. Although an attacker would have to show an electronic certificate comparable to a passport in order to decrypt the traffic, this does not pose a significant problem to professional hackers. It is not very difficult to obtain an illegitimate decryption passport that looks valid but should not have been issued in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\u003cp\u003eDANE allows to identify such attacks by adding additional passport information to the DNS database. This passport information is secured against manipulation by DNSSEC. The combination of DNSSEC and DANE has two benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA connection to the correct server is established (for example, you're connected to your bank's server, as intended).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly the bank's passport is accepted for encrypted connections. If an attacker has a duplicate passport, the connection fails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, these technologies allow secure and reliable online communication.\u003c/p\u003e",

This information is, of course, public.\n\nHowever, DNS information at deSEC is protected against manipulation using an additional security layer, DNSSEC. This requires a secret key which we use to lock the DNS information against manipulation. Whoever posses the secret key can introduce manipulations.\n\nTherefore, the secret key is located in Germany exlusively, and not accessible through the public Internet. Our DNS information is locked against manipulation using this key in a protected space.
