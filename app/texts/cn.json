            "content": "\u003cp\u003edeSEC is commited to making the Internet more secure. Our main goal is to spread the use of secure encryption technology. Private customer data are stored securely in Germany where they are protected from illegitimate third-party access (like foreign intelligence agencies): The German privacy laws are amongst the most restrictive ones world-wide.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeSEC's first product is a highly secure DNS service. Being from the 80s and not initially meant for the masses, the Internet was not designed with security in mind. Data transmitted through the Internet is by default not protected against espionage and manipulation. deSEC uses recent innovative technologies to avert such abuse, and to make the Internet more secure.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe start by cryptographically securing DNS information, to protect it from manipulation. To that end, we operate DNS servers world-wide and equipped with the DNSSEC technology, based on Google-scale infrastructure. Additionally, we increase the security of encrypted connections using DANE (see below).\u003c/p\u003e",

            "content": "The DNS technology ensures that Internet users can connect to the intended web or e-mail server when browsing the web or communicating online. To do so, it translates domain names (like www.desec.io) into a machine number (IP address) that is used for communication between computers. Being the phonebook of the Internet, the DNS also allows additional information to be stored. deSEC uses such information to validate the authenticity of encrypted connections.",

            "content": "\u003cp\u003eAs described above, DNSSEC ensures that your data is directed to the right server. But even then, attackers can intercept and read traffic before forwarding it to the intended destination. This is also true for encrypted connections. Although an attacker would have to show an electronic certificate comparable to a passport in order to decrypt the transmitted data, this requirement does not pose a significant problem to professional hackers. It is not very difficult to obtain an illegitimate decryption passport that looks valid but should not have been issued in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDANE allows to identify such attacks by adding additional passport information to the DNS database. This passport information is secured against manipulation by DNSSEC. The combination of DNSSEC and DANE has two benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA connection to the correct server is established (for example, you're connected to your bank's server, as intended).\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnly the bank's passport is accepted for encrypted connections. If an attacker along the way to the bank has a duplicate passport, the connection fails.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTogether, these technologies allow secure and reliable online communication.\u003c/p\u003e",

This information is, of course, public.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHowever, DNS information at deSEC is protected against manipulation using an additional security layer, DNSSEC. This requires a secret key which we use to lock the DNS information against manipulation. Whoever possesses the secret key can introduce manipulations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, the secret key is located in Germany exlusively, and it is not accessible through the public Internet. Our DNS information is locked against manipulation using this key in a protected space. Only after this locking procedure, the secured information is made public in the DNS lookup database so that Internet users can rely on it to establish secure connections.\u003c/p\u003e",

Logjam uses a weakness in the TLS protocol to downgrade a connection to use 512bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. At the same time, the discrete logarithm problem, on which the security of a ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange relies, can be broken within minutes for 512bit parameter size, after a precomputation of just a week. Together, these weaknesses enable a man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on the data transmitted over TLS and tamper with it. Therefore, DH key exchange with 512bit should be considered insecure in general, and parameters with 1024bit or less should be considered to be broken for an attacker with nation-level computational resources. This test checks the ephemeral DH parameters size of a given server and checks if the connection is vulnerable to downgrade attacks. Green rating of this test is achieved by using more than 1024bit DH parameter size (or no ephemeral DH key exchange at all), and no support for 512bit DH key exchange (\"export ciphers\").",
