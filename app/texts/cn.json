It is not very difficult to obtain an illegitimate decryption passport that looks valid but should not have been issued in the first place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDANE allows to identify such attacks by adding additional passport information to the DNS database.

Logjam uses a weakness in the TLS protocol to downgrade a connection to use 512bit Diffie-Hellman parameters. At the same time, the discrete logarithm problem, on which the security of a ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key exchange relies, can be broken within minutes for 512bit parameter size, after a precomputation of just a week. Together, these weaknesses enable a man-in-the-middle attacker to eavesdrop on the data transmitted over TLS and tamper with it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTherefore, DH key exchange with 512bit should be considered insecure in general, and parameters with 1024bit or less should be considered to be broken for an attacker with nation-level computational resources.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis test checks the ephemeral DH parameters size of a given server and checks if the connection is vulnerable to downgrade attacks. Green rating of this test is achieved by using more than 1024bit DH parameter size (or no ephemeral DH key exchange at all), and no support for 512bit DH key exchange (\"export ciphers\").\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003edeSEC is an Internet security service provider.
